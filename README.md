#  TRIP TO MARS

The firts project that came out of my web development bootcamp at Ironhack Barcelona.

## About the project
Trip to Mars is a platform game developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in which the player embarks on an exciting mission to Mars. The objective is to complete a space course, avoiding obstacles such as meteorites and pits, and collecting as many UFOs as possible. The game combines simple mechanics - such as moving with the arrow keys and jumping with the space bar - with a 2 minute time limit, which adds an extra challenge. This project implements interactive web design concepts, CSS animations and JavaScript game logic.
